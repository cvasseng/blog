### Introduction 
A MIDI to CV interface is essentially the bridge between the digital DAW realm and analog synthesizer setups. It's essential to a "modern" workflow that centers around a computer. 

### Features
The MIDI to CV project has the following features:
  * 2 channels of gate/trigger output
  * 2 channels of CV output
  * MIDI in (naturally)
  * MIDI thru
  * Assignable MIDI channels for the 2 CV outputs
  * Polyphonic mode (2 note) and monophonic mode
  * Clock out
  * Can run off of 5-30V
  * Compact PCB layout to fit into a eurorack module
  * A few bells and whistles - display to show the MIDI channel assigned to the outputs, LED activity indicators for the gate outputs, buttons to assign MIDI channels

### Closing words
I'm in the process of laying out a PCB for this project, once I have and have tested them, I'll post the files.
